You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

Desktop or laptop computers

Smartphones

Smart home devices

Game consoles

Storage devices or servers

Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.
